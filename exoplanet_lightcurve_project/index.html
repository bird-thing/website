        <h1>exoplanet light curve data to exoplanet radius</h1>
        <p>rough draft for a larger project, will eventually use this to actually MODEL the exoplanet orbit
            around its star. this just does the math. basically depth = planet radius / star radius squared.<br>
            except i did it like planet radius = star radius * sqrt(depth) so its easier to program. should be about the same
            except theres a weird problem where the output data is slightly different than online sources, despite the example data from HAT-P-2b
            coming out to the correct thing according to the source. so im thinking it isnt my program but maybe inconsistent data?
            the main site i would use for this isnt loading currently (2:18PM 7/29/2025). so im just trusting what i see on the internet.
            but it does come out with a number gotten from doing math with other numbers so that is good!<br>
            solar radii is the size of a star compared to our sun, planet radius comes out in terms of the planet radius compared to jupiter.<br>
            i might do this another way but it seems to be the generally accepted way.<br>
            i might also be reading graphs wrong since no one puts the stupid difference between the top and bottom of the curve.
            or... theres more to it? but what i read was just based on depth, not time. weird stuff.

        <p>next to do is getting orbit times and stuff. star size is already here. in the model have the base data be the sun and jupiter to fit
            the math. determine the sphere radii by the real data about our solar system or some math stuff but less likely to be math stuff.
            hard data would be better. also orbit radius would be good to have. theres a lot of variables. it seems to get both
            more and less complicated every time i work on this. for now, we have a math thing to do radius of the exoplanet. yeah.<br>
            now i need to ask my classmate whats going on because i was working on this instead of doing the AI storytelling program thing. oops.
