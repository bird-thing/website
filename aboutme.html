                <p>fun fact! this cat was originally supposed to be the bullet point for the list above. now it just
                    lives here.</p>
                <p>i dont really have anything else for my "about me" page. no certifications or anything. im just a
                    guy. a guy who makes stuff.</p>
                    <img src="assets/cube.gif" alt="spinning cube">
                    <p>oh also im vehemently anti generative AI because im an artist, programmer, and environmentalist.<br>
                    this is all made by hand unless i copy pasted it like a real person with intent. and i credit when i copy paste so yeah.<br>
                non-generative stuff is kinda cool but generative AI is not something i will use unless forced by a lesson and even then, im going to resist.<br>
            yes i did make the AI recipe thing on my site. i did not want to. it was for programming experience. i feel bad about even using it for testing.</p>
